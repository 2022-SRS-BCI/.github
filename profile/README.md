# 2022 DKU SRS: Explorations in Brain-Computer Interface for Creative Production

**Project Title:**<br>
Explorations in Brain-Computer Interface for Creative Production

**Project Summary:**</br>
Brain-Computer Interface has long been at the forefront of human-computer interaction since the 1970s. Recent development in this field with projects such as Elon Muskâ€™s Nerualink demonstrates not only new technical capabilities but also potential new philosophes to thinking about human-machine relationships. Additionally, open-source initiatives like OpenBCI are working to bring this technology to the masses in an accessible and affordable format with products from their 3D printable beginner headset to the soon to be released BCI-VR product Galea. Explorations in Brain-Computer Interface for Creative Production looks at the burgeoning area of BCI and through hands-on experimentation investigates its application in creative production. Ideal candidates should have programming experience (Java/Python) and/or hardware experience (Arduino / RPI). 3D printing experience is a plus.
